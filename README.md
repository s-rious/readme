## Common Errors & Interruptions:

### "Your phone currently isn't allowed to install unknown apps from this source"
- This error occurs due to the application being installed from a source outside of the Play Protect system, such as your browser.
- This error can be fixed by pressing the "Settings" button at the bottom and toggling *ON* to "Allow from this source"

### "Blocked by Play Protect"
- This error occurs due to the unknown signature of the developer.
- This error can be disregarded as it is simply a verification that you are aware that the developer, 'Cameron Rydwell', is not known to the Play Protect system due to it being downloaded from an outside source.
- Simply tap "Install Anyway" and the application will continue to install until complete.

### "Send app for scanning?"
- This error occurs due to Play Protect not having any data or history on the application 'Rydwell Schools'.
- This error can be disregarded as, like the "Blocked by Play Protect" error, it is just not recognized by the Play Protect system due to it being downloaded from an outside source.
- Simply tap "Send" or "Don't send", and you will be on your way with using the application.

### Any additional bugs, complaints, or errors that occur can be emailed to the developer directly:
